# cachalot (w/o capitals please)

cachalot is a ready-to-code theme for prestashop 1.5.

## Philosophy

cachalot follows few points as a "philisophy" of use. Here they are :

+ No grids
+ No ID styling
+ Meaningful, semantic and re-usable classes
+ No unecessary vendor prefix.
+ Web Performances first, as possible.
+ em for font-sizes, px for the rest.

## TODO List

1. Review every CSS
2. Review every TPL
3. Adapts javascript files (if necessary)
4. Swap to HTML5 tags
5. Preview a port for prestashop 1.6
